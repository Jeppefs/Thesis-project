// This file describes each parameter and possible settings for the model. 

NHosts: Number of agents 
InfectionSpeed: The rate of which malaria spreads.
ImmunitySpeed: The rate of gaining immunity to a single antigen.  Always set to 1.0 
MutationSpeed: The rate of strains to switch a random antigen to a new random one. 
DeathSpeed: The rate of agents death. 
NAntigens: The number of antigens each strain contains
MaxAntigenValue: The maximum value a single antigen can take. In other words it decides the number of different antigens. 

SingleFiles: At each simulation for each parameter, should a data file be saved? 
Runs: Number of runs for each parameter.
BurnIn: The number of runs for a burin-in
Test: If true then no data will be saved. 
# Repeat: How many runs there should be over the same parameters. This is to calculate average and variance. 
AppendToCurrentDataFile: This file determines if a new data file should be created, or if the data should simply be appended to the data files. 
ShouldHaveMultipleInfections: Decides if it is possible to have multiple infections at once.
CurrentDataFile: The name of the data file 

Runs -> Runs

SaveAtIteration -> If ShouldSaveDataWhileRunning is true then this value is how many runs must elapse to save the data.
